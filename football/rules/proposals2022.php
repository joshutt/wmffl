    <b>Proposal 2022.1 - Reduce 60 yard FG points</b>
    <b>Sponsor: Richard Lawson</b><br/>
    <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">Rejected, 5-6</span></span><br/>
    Reduce the number of points a 60+ yard field goal from 10 pts to 6 pts

    <b>Sponsor: Richard Lawson</b><br/>
    <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">Rejected, 1-10, 1 Abstain</span></span><br/>
    Make it so that all missed FG get -1 pt.  Not just extra points and FGs under 30 yards.

    <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">Rejected, 5-6</span></span><br/>
    Make it so that all missed FG under 50 yuards get -1 pt.  Not just extra points and FGs under 30 yards.

    <b>Proposal 2022.3 - Game Changing FG points</b>
    <b>Sponsor: Richard Lawson</b><br/>
    <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">Rejected, 3-9</span></span><br/>
    Bonus 5 points if your kicker kicks a field goal that either:
    <ul><li>Changes the outcome of a game in the last 20 seconds of regulation (e.g. a kick that changes a tie to a win or a loss to a tie/win)
    <ul><li>If A vs B is tied w 20secs left and A kicks a FG they get bonus 5 points. If B then kicks a field goal to tie with say 4 seconds left they get 5 points. If A then kicks a FG to walkoff in OT they get 5 more points. This is the most extreme example that will hardly ever happen</li>
    <li>If A is leading B by 4 points and throws a TD with 5 seconds left they go 2 points up and the PAT would not result in a bonus 5 points (going from a win to a win)</li></ul></li>
    <li>Is a walk off kick in OT</li></ul>

    <b>Proposal 2022.4 - Roster Plus IR Limits to 28</b>
    <b>Sponsor: Richard Lawson</b><br/>
    <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">Passed, 8-3, 1 abstain</span></span><br/>
    At one point Norseman had a squad size of 34. It's too many. I suggest to keep the existing squad size of 25 and keep the existing IR/COVID setup we have but have a rule that the total of the squad + IR/COVID can only be maximum 28. It could be 20 squad and 8 IR/COVID if desired
    <blockquote class="mb-0 mt-2 px-3"><i>Add rule IV.C.5 reading:<br/>
        5. No team may have more the 28 players combined between the IR and active roster.

    <b>Proposal 2022.5 - Add a 15th Game to the Season</b>
    <b>Sponsor: Richard Lawson</b><br/>
    <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">Rejected, 5-6, 1 Abstain</span></span><br/>
     As the regular season gets 1 week longer should our season. I think it is worth discussion having a 15 week reg season.  I would suggest that the extra game be defined as:<br/>
     <p><blockquote><p>
     In even number years<br/>
     Burgundy #1 vs Gold #4<br/>
     Burgundy #2 vs Gold #3<br/>
     Burgundy #3 vs White #2<br/>
     Burgundy #4 vs White #1<br/>
     Gold #1 vs White #4<br/>
     Gold #2 vs White #3</p>

     <p>In odd number years<br/>
     Burgundy #1 vs White#4<br/>
     Burgundy #2 vs White#3<br/>
     Burgundy #3 vs Gold#2<br/>
     Burgundy #4 vs Gold#1<br/>
     White #1 vs Gold#4<br/>
     White#2 vs Gold#3</p>

    Change the threshold needed to pass a new rule to 50% + 1 of the vote
