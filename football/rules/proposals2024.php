    <b>Proposal 2024.1 - Get rid of IR and increase roster to 26</b>
    <b>Sponsor: Richard Lawson</b><br/>
    <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">Under Discussion</span></span><br/>
    I like IR as a concept but I just feel it is too inconsistent to manage.<br/>
    Couple of occasions where players have been activated Sunday morning on the site and resulted in dropping players from squads. Jason Myers for Bulldogs and De'Von Achane for Lionhearts. That is fine but I feel it is inconsistent.<br/>
    Irregardless I think it's too tricky to navigate for us and I think I would shelve it and go 26 man leagues....up to you if you hold on to players who are injured on not.

    <b>Proposal 2024.2 - Dealing with players coming off IR late in week</b>
    <b>Sponsor: Josh Utterback</b><br/>
    <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">Under Discussion</span></span><br/>
    There has been a lot of inconsiency with when players come off IR causing teams to be unexpectantly over roster limits.  To prevent this
    any player coming off of IR on Saturday or Sunday (due to removal from NFL IR) will not count against the roster limit for that week, unless that player was activated
    by the WMFFL team.  (Also removes obsolete COVID list rule)
    <blockquote class="mb-0 mt-2 px-3"><i>Change rule IV.C.4 to read:<br/>
            <blockquote>
            4. Any player on the IR on Friday and removed from the NFL IR on Saturday or Sunday of a given week, will not count against the
            roster limits in IV.A for that given week unless they are activated as a starter by the WMFFL team.</blockquote>

    Increase the bye week penalty to 5 points<br/>
    Increase all other activations violations to $5 fines and 10 point penalties
