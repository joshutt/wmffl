    <b>Proposal 2020.1 - Add Injured Reserve</b>
    <b>Sponsor: Jon Hall </b><br/>
    <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">Passed, 10-2</span></span><br/>
    Add an injured reserve. Any player on the NFL IR may be designated by the WMFFL team as an IR player. If so
    designated
    that player will remain on their roster but will not count towards the 25 rostered players. A player on IR may not
    be
    activated. Once removed from the IR by the NFL team, the player must be removed from the WMFFL IR and the team must
    restore
    thier roster limits.<br/>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Any player on IR will not be counted towards the roster limits in rule

    <b>Proposal 2020.2 - Require Monday Night Activations</b>
    <b>Sponsor: Josh Utterback</b><br/>
    <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">Rejected, 1-8, 3 No Votes</span></span><br/>
    Each week every WMFFL team must activate at least one player whose team plays on Monday night. Failure to do so will
    result
    in that team's flex player being considered an illegal activation.<br/>
    <blockquote class="mb-0 mt-2 px-3"><i>Add rule V.A.3.d (or V.A.3.e if proposal 2020.1 passes) reading:</br>
            d. Failure to activate a player whose NFL team plays on Monday will result in the flex position activation
            being treated as if they were not on an NFL team</br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. This restriction will be waived in any week where there are not any NFL games
            scheduled for Monday.

    <b>Proposal 2020.3 - COVID-19 Opt-out List</b>
    <b>Sponsor: Mike Atlas</b><br/>
    <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">Pulled</span></span><br/>
    There should be some form of COVID list. Teams get one slot to keep a player, at no protection cost or roster spot,
    who is on the "official" opt-out list for 2020. Once identified and put on the list, this player will not be
    available to be activated in 2020 regardless of future decisions in 2020. For the 2021 season, this player will be
    available for keeping per normal costs. <br/>

    <b>Proposal 2020.4 - COVID-19 IR List</b>
    <b>Sponsor: Mike Atlas</b><br/>
    <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">Passed, 8-3, 1 abstain</span></span><br/>
    There should be some form of COVID list. Teams get one (or two?) active COVID-IR slots to place a player during the
    season, who is required to quarantine due to COVID by a list we agree upon. Players on this IR do not count against
    your total roster count, but when moved back to active status a roster spot will be required like any addition to
    the team.<br/>

    Seems ridiculous to treat this as a “real” year.  Eliminate the entry fee as well as Any “winnings” for this year.
