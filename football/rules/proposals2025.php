        <b>Proposal 2025.1 - Reduce Kicker Points</b>
        <b>Sponsor: Thomas Marsh</b><br/>
        <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">In Disucssion</span></span><br/>
        <p>Reducing the kicker points to below.</p>

        <p>
            Made 0-39 yards = 1 pts<br/>
            Made 40-49 yards = 2 pts<br/>
            Made 50-59 yards = 3 pts<br/>
            Made 60+ yards = 5 pts
        </p>

        Missed kicks and EPs would be unchanged. Based on my numbers, this would reduce overall kicker points by about
        40%.

        <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">In Disucssion</span></span><br/>
        <p>We should not give kickers more or less points than the kick was actually worth. Who cares how long the
            kick was. It really doesn’t make a difference. Short kicks can be great too. I say all kicks are worth three
            regardless of distance. PATs are still worth one.</p>

        <b>Proposal 2025.3 - Eliminate Head Coaches</b>
        <b>Sponsor: Chris Heywood</b><br/>
        <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">In Disucssion</span></span><br/>
        <p>I propose eliminating the head coach position. In the past, I supported the head coach. But, I changed my
            mind.
            There has Coach has nothing to do with penalties and point differentials. It is real just an a bet on the
            difference between the strength of your coach’s NFL team and the relative strength of their opponents. This
            really has nothing to do with fantasy football.</p>

        <b>Proposal 2025.4 - Make DL a Team Unit</b>
        <b>Sponsor: Chris Heywood</b><br/>
        <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">In Disucssion</span></span><br/>
        <p> I propose changing the selection of individual defensive lineman to simply selecting a defensive line from
            an
            NFL team. Same as we do with offensive lines. Why are we treating offensive lines and defensive lines
            differently? Does anyone really care about individual defensive lineman?</p>

        <b>Proposal 2025.5 - Make TE a flex position</b>
        <b>Sponsor: Chris Heywood</b><br/>
        <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">In Disucssion</span></span><br/>
        <p>I propose that we changed the tight end position to a flex position. There are simply not enough good tight
            ends to go around. And only a few teams benefit from this position. Instead of having to select a tight end,
            we should be able to select either an additional running back, an additional wide receiver or a tight
            end.</p>

        <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">In Disucssion</span></span><br/>
        <p>I would very much support adding a DT position, or changing the DL rule to something like our flex rule on
            offense, where you pick, say, 3 DLs and one must be listed as a DT.</p>

        <p> I would also support a LB/Secondary flex where we pick 5 players at S, CB, or LB with the a rule that you
        must have at least one of each.</p>
