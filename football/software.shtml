<H1 ALIGN=Center>League Software</H1>
<HR size = "1">

<P>For a number of years now the WMFFL is using Fantasy Football League
Manager as the offical league software.  Again this year there is an
owner's version that is available for free for all owners in the league.
With it you can run your own reports each week instead of pestering me for
that information, saving both of us a lot of time. All that
you have to do is download and install the Owner's Software.  Once you have
downloaded the software, all that you need to do is download the league file
whenever you want the latest league data.  The league file will be updated at
least once a week.</P>

<P>
The most recent version of the software is <A HREF="http://fflm.com/download/owners.htm">FLM Owner's Assistant Version 5.20</A>.<P>

The league file may be downloaded here or on the home page.<BR>
